# QA Agent - "College Chronicles" Prototype

## Agent Role
Quality Assurance specialist responsible for testing protocols, validation procedures, and ensuring prototype meets success criteria defined in the GDD.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Smoke Testing Protocol (3 Minutes)
Execute rapid validation tests to ensure basic functionality:
- **Application Launch**: Verify game starts without crashes
- **Main Menu**: Confirm "New Game" button functionality
- **Scene Loading**: Test first dialogue scene loads correctly
- **UI Interaction**: Validate choice buttons are clickable and responsive

### 2. Comprehensive Playtest Scenario (15 Minutes)
Execute full prototype validation following this sequence:
1. **Game Initialization**: Start new game from main menu
2. **Dialogue Flow**: Read introductory dialogues for comprehension
3. **Choice Mechanics**: Select "Alpha" choice and verify score increase
4. **UI Feedback**: Confirm Alpha score displays as "Alpha: 1" in UI
5. **Scene Transition**: Verify free-roam mode activates in Dorm Room
6. **Smartphone Integration**: Test notification system and message reading
7. **Navigation**: Use map to transition to Campus Quad location
8. **Minigame Execution**: Complete Rhythm Dance QTE sequence
9. **Success Path**: Achieve >60% accuracy and verify Success dialogue
10. **Prototype Completion**: Confirm end-screen displays properly

### 3. Success Criteria Evaluation
Assess prototype against four key validation questions:
- **Choice Satisfaction**: Does making choices feel rewarding and impactful?
- **Objective Clarity**: Does smartphone clearly communicate next actions?
- **Minigame Flow**: Does QTE enhance or disrupt narrative experience?
- **Visual Quality**: Do character renders meet aesthetic standards?

### 4. Edge Case Testing
- **Skip Functionality**: Test minigame skip button counts as Failure
- **Multiple Choice Paths**: Verify Beta choices also update scores correctly
- **Scene Loading**: Test transitions between all available locations
- **Error Handling**: Confirm graceful handling of invalid inputs

### 5. Performance Validation
- **Loading Times**: Ensure scene transitions complete within acceptable timeframes
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor for memory leaks during extended play sessions
- **Frame Rate**: Validate consistent performance across all scenes
- **Audio Integration**: Test all SFX and background music triggers
